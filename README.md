# AI-Generated Novel Antibodies Targeting Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G

<h3 align="right">Silico Biosciences</h3>

Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly lethal zoonotic pathogen whose Glycoprotein G (NiV-G) mediates viral attachment to human Ephrin-B2/B3 receptors, enabling infection of respiratory and neural tissues. Because no licensed vaccines or therapeutics exist for humans, NiV-G is a critical target for antiviral intervention. In this study, we aimed to design high-affinity antibody-like binders capable of blocking or disrupting the NiV-G interaction with its native receptors. Our approach focused on generating and evaluating candidate binders predicted to engage key receptor-binding regions of NiV-G. The results provide insights into binder architectures and interaction motifs that may inform future development of therapeutic antibodies or diagnostic tools for Nipah virus outbreaks.
