## Submission Overview

Our submission focuses on the generation of targeted antibodies that bind to Nipah virus glycoprotein G. We primarily utilized our new suite of antibody language models called peleke-1 (silico.bio/peleke), which generate heavy and light chain Fv sequences given an epitope-annotated antigen sequence as input.

We then co-folded the peleke-1-generated sequences and selected for candidates that were predicted to bind at the desired epitope (the binding site of ephrin-B2 from PDB 2VSM) with multiple molecular interactions with the antigen.

For some candidates, we utilized ProteinMPNN to generate additional derivative sequences based on a peleke-1-generated antibody or reference antibody (e.g. m102.3). The use of ProteinMPNN produced more varied sequences, some of which are predicted to exhibit desired binding properties.

Notes: All sequences are the heavy and light Fv chain sequences connected by a (G3S)4 linker. Also, all generated sequences were numbered through the Chothia numbering system to ensure that they all are antibody-like sequences.

## Method

peleke-1 + ProteinMPNN

## Description
Using the sbio-nipahgpg-001 antibody generated by the peleke-phi-4 model, which exhibited the same binding site of ephrin-B2 as the epitope, ProteinMPNN was used to generate a derivative sequence given the antibody structure at that location.

## Method

ProteinMPNN

## Description

Using the m102.3 antibody from PDB 6CM1 (Hendra virus), the glycoprotein G antigen structure was replaced with the Nipha virus structure from PDB 2VSM. Then, ProteinMPNN was used to generate novel antibody sequences based on the m102.3 structure as the scaffold given its positional conformation to the antigen structure.

Models: v_48_020
Temperature: 0.1


## Method

General LLM

## Description

Using the m102.3 antibody from PDB 6CM1 (Hendra virus), the LLM was prompted to generate a similar Fv sequence that would bind to the glycoprotein G antigen structure of Nipha virus from PDB 2VSM.
